# Web infrastructure design
An ALX project in which I began to research on web infrastructure design. As I conducted research on different design principles, I whiteboarded diagrams of developing web infrastructure. I started with a simple LAMP model and ended with a fully distributed, monitored, and secured system.

Files in this project contain links to each respective whiteboard diagram.
